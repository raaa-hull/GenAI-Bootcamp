        "### **Objective**\n",
        "This final project is your capstone challenge, designed to give you an opportunity to showcase everything you’ve learned throughout the \"100 Next-Gen AI Bootcamp\". Your task is to conceive, design, and build a functional AI-powered application that demonstrates your comprehensive understanding of the modern AI engineering lifecycle.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Assignment: Identify a Problem, Build the Solution**\n",
        "\n",
        "Your core task is to:\n",
        "1.  **Identify a meaningful problem or workflow** that can be significantly improved or automated using the AI techniques covered in this bootcamp.\n",
        "2.  **Design and architect a solution** that leverages the most appropriate tools and concepts for your chosen problem.\n",
        "3.  **Implement a working prototype** of your solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "You have complete freedom to choose your domain and use case. The goal is to showcase your ability to think critically like an AI Engineer, make reasoned technical decisions, and deliver a valuable AI application.\n",

        "### **Core Requirements & Expected Components**\n",
        "\n",
        "Your final submission **must** incorporate and demonstrate your proficiency in the following areas, regardless of the use case you choose:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **LLM Integration (Core Engine):**\n",
        "    *   Your solution must be built around a Large Language Model.\n",
        "    *   There is no restriction on the model provider or the model type — you may choose any LLM that suits your usecase.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Application of a Core AI Pattern:**\n",
        "    *   Your project must clearly implement at least one of the major architectural patterns we studied:\n",
        "        *   **Advanced RAG System:** For solutions that require grounding in external knowledge (e.g., querying documents, websites, or APIs). Your implementation must include at least one advanced technique (Reranking, Query Rewriting, Hybrid Search, etc.).\n",
        "        *   **Agentic AI System:** For solutions that require autonomous decision-making and action. Your agent must have a clear goal, a reasoning loop (e.g., ReAct), and use at least two custom-defined tools.\n",
        "        *   **Hybrid ML + GenAI System:** For solutions that combine traditional data analysis with generative capabilities (e.g., using clustering to find insights and an LLM to interpret and summarize them).\n",
        "    * The more key concepts and techniques you successfully demonstrate in your assignment submission, the higher your project is likely to be scored.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Clear Problem-Solution Articulation:**\n",
        "    * Your documentation must clearly define the problem you chose and justify why your AI solution is an effective approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Deliverables**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Source Code:** A well-organized and commented Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) or a collection of well-commented Python scripts (`.py`) containing all the code for your project.\n",
        "2.  **Comprehensive `README.md` File:** This is a critical component of your submission. It must include:\n",
        "    *   **Problem Statement:** A clear and concise description of the problem you chose to solve.\n",
        "    *   **Solution Overview:** A high-level explanation of your AI application and how it addresses the problem.\n",
        "    *   **Architecture & Design Rationale:** A detailed section explaining the technical choices you made and *why*.\n",
        "        *   *Example Justifications: \"I chose an Agentic AI pattern because my problem required sequential tool use...\", \"I implemented a reranker in my RAG pipeline to improve precision with noisy legal documents...\", \"My chunking strategy was X because...\"*\n",
        "    *   **Setup and Usage Instructions:** Clear steps on how to set up the environment (including API keys) and run your prototype.\n",
        "3.  **Video Demonstration:** A short screen recording (maximum 3 minutes) where you:\n",
        "    *   Briefly present your problem statement.\n",
        "    *   Provide a live demo of your working application.\n",

        "*   **Problem-Solution Fit & Conception (20%):** How well did you identify a suitable problem and design an effective AI solution for it?\n",
        "*   **Technical Execution & Application of Concepts (50%):** Does the prototype work as described? How effectively did you implement the core AI patterns (RAG, Agents) and advanced techniques?\n",
        "*   **Code Quality & Documentation (15%):** Is your code clean, modular, and well-commented? Is your `README.md` thorough, clear, and insightful, especially in its rationale for design choices?\n",
        "*   **Presentation & Demo (15%):** How effectively do you communicate the purpose and functionality of your project in your video?\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Submission Instructions**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Deadline:** You have until **November 14** to submit all the deliverables for your project. Any submissions after this date will not be considered.\n",
        "2.  **Platform:** All submissions must be made to your allocated private GitLab repository. You **must** submit your work in a branch named `final_project`.\n",
        "3.  **Format:** You can submit your work as either a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) or a collection of Python scripts (`.py`).\n",
        "4.  After pushing, you should verify that your branch and files are visible on the GitLab web interface. No further action is needed. The trainers will review all submissions on the `final_project` branch after the deadline. Any assignments submitted after the deadline won't be reviewed and will reflect in your course score.\n",
        "5. The use of LLMs is encouraged, but ensure that you’re not copying solutions blindly. Always review, test, and understand any code generated, adapting it to the specific requirements of your assignment. Your submission should demonstrate your own comprehension, problem-solving process, and coding style, not just an unedited output from an AI tool."
