        "\n",
        "The goal of this assignment is to use advanced prompting techniques and your understanding of LLM fundamentals to analyze and extract structured information from raw customer feedback. This project will test your skills in tokenization and prompt engineering (few-shot, structured output, and chain-of-thought).\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Background & Problem Statement**\n",
        "\n",
        "You are an AI Engineer at a growing e-commerce company. The customer support team is manually reading through hundreds of product reviews every day to identify key issues and sentiment. This process is slow and inconsistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your manager has asked you to build a prototype that uses a Large Language Model to automate this analysis. Specifically, you need to prove that you can:\n",
        "1.  Classify the sentiment of a review.\n",
        "2.  Extract specific, structured information (like product names and issues).\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Dataset**\n",
        "\n",
        "For this assignment, you will work with a small, curated list of customer reviews. This allows you to focus on the quality of your prompts rather than on data cleaning. Use the following Python list as your dataset:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "reviews = [\n",
        "    # Review 1: Positive\n",

        "    # Review 5: Positive but mentions a minor issue\n",

        "    2.  **Task B: Structured Data Extraction (Instruction & Format Prompting)**\n",
        "        *   Design a prompt that instructs the model to extract the following information from each review and format the output as a JSON object: `{\"product_name\": \"...\", \"issue_summary\": \"...\", \"sentiment\": \"...\"}`.\n",

        "        *   For the **negative and mixed reviews only** (reviews 2, 3, 4, 5), design a **Chain-of-Thought prompt**.\n",

        "2.  **Platform:** All submissions must be made to your allocated private GitLab repository. You **must** submit your work in a branch named `week_2`.\n",
        "3.  **Format:** You can submit your work as either a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) or a Python script (`.py`).\n",
        "4.  After pushing, you should verify that your branch and files are visible on the GitLab web interface. No further action is needed. The trainers will review all submissions on the `week_2` branch after the deadline. Any assignments submitted after the deadline won't be reviewed and will reflect in your course score.\n",
        "5. The use of LLMs is encouraged, but ensure that you’re not copying solutions blindly. Always review, test, and understand any code generated, adapting it to the specific requirements of your assignment. Your submission should demonstrate your own comprehension, problem-solving process, and coding style, not just an unedited output from an AI tool."
